## How to play

To play the game, run the file `main.py`.

There's a little bit of music at the start of the game, so turn your volume on.  ^^

`ship_log.txt` will contain a log of important things you've learned, and items you've picked up.  It also doubles as your save file.  Saving is automatic.

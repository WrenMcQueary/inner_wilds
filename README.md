# Inner Wilds

A little text-based game inspired by [Outer Wilds](https://store.steampowered.com/app/753640/Outer_Wilds/), for the love of my life.

I made the underlying graph for this game using [Obsidian Canvas](https://obsidian.md/canvas), and built a parser that turns Obsidian Canvas graphs into playable text-adventure games!

## Required packages

- `playsound`

## How to play

To play the game, run the file `main.py`.

There's a little bit of music at the start of the game, so turn your volume on.  ^^

`ship_log.txt` will contain a log of important things you've learned, and items you've picked up.  It also doubles as your save file.  Every time you make a choice, the game autosaves.

To quit, press Ctrl + C.
